## 🧑 About Me  
I’m an aspiring **self-learning software developer** from **Delhi, India**.  

- Completed schooling in **Science (Computer Science + C++ + SQL)**, graduated in **2020**.  
- Took a 5-year break from formal studies, kept learning **Mathematics** and **Physics** on my own.  
- Briefly attended college (dropped out in 3rd year).  
- Restarted coding in **2024** after discovering small programming tasks on crowdsourcing platforms.  
- First exposure came through **C++ projects**, which inspired me to explore **Computer Science, Web, Networks, and AI**.  
- Now, I’m committed to **learning, building projects, and documenting my journey** here.
